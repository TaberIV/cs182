		Find the order of growth  for solutions of the following recurrences
a. T(n) = 4T(n/2) + n, T(1) = 1
	a = 4, b = 2, d =1
	log24 = 2 > d = 1
	O(nlogbn)
b. T(n) = 4T(n/2) + n2, T(1) = 1
	a = 4, b = 2, d =2
	log24 = 2 = d = 2
	O(n2logn)
c. T(n) = 4T(n/2) + n3, T(1) = 1
	a = 4, b = 2, d =3
	log24 = 2 < d = 3
	O(n3)
